      "Bored with standard educational practices, I decided to travel the country and made lifetime memories along the way. Post travels I returned to my mechanical career path. Ended up in Denver, Colorado where I made some of the best friends and memories of my life. Returning to south Louisiana some years later...still in the powersports industry, I was on the search for something bigger, better, and more rewarding. I got into cryptocurrencies and day trading. Furthermore, that led to an extreme interest in web design and software development.",
